# QA Assessment - FastAPI Full Stack Template

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive QA assessment for the **FastAPI Full Stack Template**, featuring an automated E2E test suite built with **Playwright** and **TypeScript**. The assessment demonstrates end-to-end testing capabilities through realistic user interactions that validate both frontend and backend functionality.

## 1. Project Selection and Rationale

I chose the [FastAPI Full Stack Template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template) because it provides a complete but lean stack with:

- React + TypeScript frontend
- FastAPI backend with automatic API documentation
- SQLModel with PostgreSQL database
- Built-in authentication and user management
- Docker Compose setup for easy local development

This template runs locally with Docker Compose, has clear documentation, and maintains recent releases. This allows focus on test design and automation rather than complex infrastructure setup.

**Target System:**

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger)
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
- Database admin: http://localhost:8080 (Adminer)
- Email testing: http://localhost:1080 (MailCatcher)

## 2. Test Strategy and Approach

### Scope and Objectives

**‚úÖ In Scope:**

- Validate core user journeys end-to-end through the UI
- Confirm authentication and session behavior
- Verify CRUD operations on entities in the sample app
- Exercise client-to-server integration and API error surfacing
- Produce a maintainable TypeScript automation suite

**‚ùå Out of Scope:**

- Performance and load testing
- Security penetration testing
- Multi-locale support and extensive visual regression testing

### Testing Approach

**Manual Testing:**

- Exploratory passes to map user flows, application states, and edge cases
- Targeted validation checks and navigation testing

**Automated Testing:**

- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Strategy**: Semantic selectors, data builders, authentication fixtures
- **Coverage**: Critical flows with both positive and negative test paths
- **CI/CD Ready**: Headless execution with comprehensive HTML reporting

## 3. Test Coverage and Cases

## 5. Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure:

1. **FastAPI Full Stack Template is running** via Docker with all services accessible
2. **Admin credentials configured** - you'll need the `FIRST_SUPERUSER` and `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` values
3. **Node.js 18+** installed on your system
4. **Git** for version control

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone and navigate to the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd qa-assessment-fastapi-playwright-carlos-daniel
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and fill in your admin credentials:

   ```env
   APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@example.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password
   ```

## 6. Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests (headless)
npm test

# Run tests with browser UI visible
npm run test:headed

# Run tests with Playwright UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/auth/login.spec.ts

# Run tests in specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

### Test Reports and Debugging

```bash
# View HTML test report
npm run report

# Run with debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Run with trace viewer
npx playwright test --trace on

# Show trace file
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint TypeScript files
npm run lint

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

## 7. Environment and Test Data Strategy

### Test Environment

- **Base**: Local Docker Compose setup as provided by the template
- **Database**: Fresh PostgreSQL instance via Adminer
- **Email Testing**: MailCatcher for email verification flows
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik handling service routing

### Test Data Management

- **Admin User**: Created from environment variables for superuser access
- **Regular Users**: Created dynamically via UI during test execution
- **Entity Records**: Synthetic CRUD data created and cleaned per test
- **Isolation**: Each test uses fresh browser contexts for complete isolation

### Environment Variables

| Variable         | Description              | Default                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `APP_BASE_URL`   | Frontend application URL | `http://localhost:5173` |
| `API_BASE_URL`   | Backend API URL          | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL`    | Admin user email         | _(required)_            |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin user password      | _(required)_            |

## 8. Configuration and Resilience

### Playwright Configuration

The test suite is optimized for:

- **Headless execution** by default for CI/CD
- **Retry logic**: 1 retry in CI environments, 0 retries locally
- **Failure artifacts**: Screenshots, videos, and traces captured on failure
- **Consistent viewport**: 1280x800 for stable rendering across tests
- **Parallel execution**: Tests run concurrently for faster feedback

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Flaky Selectors** ‚Üí Semantic role-based locators with explicit waits
- **Data Coupling** ‚Üí Isolated users and ID-based cleanup between tests
- **Auth State Leakage** ‚Üí Per-test browser contexts with storage state reset
- **Network Instability** ‚Üí Configurable timeouts and retry mechanisms

## 9. Entry and Exit Criteria

### Entry Criteria ‚úÖ

- FastAPI application builds successfully and all services report healthy
- Admin user credentials are available and verified
- Test environment accessible at expected URLs

### Exit Criteria ‚úÖ

- All planned test scenarios executed successfully
